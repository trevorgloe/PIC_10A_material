// Lets make a program for a data science application
// Setup: suppose you are working for a grocery store selling fruit, and they want to know some analytics about how the fruit has been selling
// specifically they want to know what time of day the most sales happen, what the most popular fruit is, and who bought the most fruit
// They give you a big text file with over a hundred names of people, what they purchased, what time of day, and how much they spent

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	// first we need to create a struct to store a single purchase	

	return 0;
}
